    "# Most Valuable Customers\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Background\n",
    " The (hypothetical) company in which I work as a senior data analyst, Summit Outfitters, has recently secured a substantial round of investment to expand its market presence both online and in flagship stores located in prime outdoor destinations. Summit Outfitters is known for its premium gear catering to outdoor enthusiasts, including climbers, hikers, skiers, and trail runners. \n",
    " \n",
    " The company has maintained steady growth through a loyal customer base and strong brand reputation. Now, under the strategic guidance of our visionary CEO, Alex Rivera, Summit Outfitters is ready to leverage its current momentum and tap into broader markets. Alex believes that a deep understanding of the company's current customer base will allow us to refine our marketing efforts, enhance product offerings, and increase sales efficiency, leading us to new heights of success. \n",
    "\n",
    " Alex Rivera approached me with a strategic request from the recent investment round. The investors are interested in maximizing returns by enhancing the efficiency of marketing spend and increasing the average customer lifetime value. They want to focus on two key areas:\n",
    " - Identifying the most valuable customers from the existing customer base. What makes these customers valuable? The goal is to understand what makes these customers valuable, whether it's through their purchasing patterns, loyalty, or average transaction value. This understanding will help in tailoring marketing campaigns and loyalty programs that effectively target and retain these segments.\n",
    " - Exploring cross-selling and up-selling opportunities. With a diverse range of products, from technical climbing gear to premium outdoor apparel, Alex believes there is untapped potential in cross-selling and upselling. He wants you to use the customer transaction data to identify opportunities where customers purchasing certain items might be interested in others. For example, customers buying high-end skis might be potential targets for premium ski wear or exclusive ski accessories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex expects a comprehensive report that not only identifies key customer segments and outlines potential cross-sell and upsell strategies but also provides actionable insights and practical recommendations for targeted marketing initiatives. The focus is on enhancing customer experience and maximizing revenue per customer, and my expertise will play a significant part in achieving these goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "To address Alex Rivera's strategic request, I will follow a structured approach that involves the following key steps:\n",
    "1. Understand the problem, including the definitions of individual words/concepts.\n",
    "2. Determine a minimum viable answer that we can use to make a decision and prompt further questions.\n",
    "3. Identify any additional information that would be helpful (data, people, etc.) to have to get the minimum viable answer.\n",
    "4. Obtain the data. \n",
    "5. Plan and execute the work required to get the minimum viable answer.\n",
    "6. Review the results and determine if we need to do more work.\n",
    "7. Iterate as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understand\n",
    "- **Most Valuable Customers**: These are customers who contribute significantly to the company's revenue and profitability. They may exhibit high purchase frequency, high average transaction value, or long-term loyalty.\n",
    "- **Cross-Selling**: This involves selling additional products or services to an existing customer. The goal is to increase the customer's value by offering complementary or related items.\n",
    "- **Up-Selling**: This involves persuading a customer to buy a more expensive version of a product or to add features or upgrades. The goal is to increase the customer's spending per transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum Viable Answers\n",
    "1. Who are our most valuable customers?\n",
    "2. In which customer segments can we leverage cross-selling and up-selling opportunities?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "*This data comes from the publicly-avaiable [Online Retail Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassaneskikri/online-retail-customer-churn-dataset) on Kaggle. For the sake of this case study, let's pretend that it came from our company's data lake.*\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran the following query on our company's data lake to pull the relevant data:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "with customer_bio as (\n",

    "from customer_bio cb join customer_activity ca on cb.Customer_ID = ca.Customer_ID\n",
    "limit 1000;\n",
    "```\n",
